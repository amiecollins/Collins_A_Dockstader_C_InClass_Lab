	<article><img src="images/zelda_title.jpg" alt="Title image: Zelda Breath of the Wild" class="imageresize">
	<p>Breath of the wild is the best game ever, it is Fallout meets Minecraft meets the iconic Zelda franchise and the result of this baby is a masterpiece of no comparison. Many features that are precious to games are seen in their ideal forms such as exploration, player choice and non-restrictive narrative. The game is easy to learn and impossible to master, with much depth and many secrets in the game to be discovered. It balances between accessibility and difficulty well by having some optional challenges and a fairly well-rounded main campaign. The story immersive but builds upon the Zelda lore already present in the series, creating a nostalgic feeling to the music, landscape and character designs. </p>

	<p>Korok seeds are an example of secrets you can find in the game, and there are so many of them (900!!!) that its almost impossible to find all of them without help from an online guide. They are rewards for the player looking in every possible corner of the map, and messing with every individual thing. It makes the game exciting during the slower moments and helps make you feel accomplished for exploring.</p>

	<p>While the game is easy to complete without much direction, many of the optional puzzles and shines are very difficult and require outside of the box thinking. Additionally, there are a few extremely difficult enemies such as the Lynel that are almost impossible to defeat without much knowledge and skill of the game, however they can usually be avoided through stealth. These varying degrees of difficulty make for a good time for everyone.</p>

	<p>The immersive story shouldnâ€™t be spoiled so there is not much to say here. The story is mostly revealed though cutscenes after boss battles and discovering memory spots in the world. It is a classic Zelda story of heroics and fate meeting together and is something to experience for yourself.</p>

	<p>To conclude, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best game ever since discovery and exploration are well-rewarded with secrets to be discovered in game, the game is easy yet difficult when you want it to be and the story is immersive without disrupting gameplay. It is obvious to see that this game is an absolute masterpiece.</p>

	<h1> Breath of the wild is NOT the best game ever. </h1>
	<article><p>Breath of the wild is a magnificiant game. It is one of the biggest open worlds in gaming history and if full of secrets for young gamers to discover. A famly friendly game for vetren Zelda players and the new generation of children to enjoy. So one would be quick to claim it is the best Zelda game ever. Maybe even the best open world game out there. But with a game as big as this one there are many problems hidden within that most people over look or just choose to ignor when reveiwing the game.</p> <p> firstly, the size of the open world is very impressive but it lacks content. one of the best parts of The Legend of Zelda series is the fun or exploring dungons and finding secrets hidden in deep caves and temples. In the Breath of the Wild it lacks interesting secrets to find. The game encourages players to find Korok seeds as one of the side quests and this is what Nintendo expects to catch the eye of young players. This could've been a fun quest in Breath of the Wild if it wasn't for the fact that each time you collect a seed the charactors say the exact same lines, sounds, and animations. 900 times! thats right you have to collect 900 of these uninteresting seeds to gain a large prize. Once you collect a good handful of seeds there is an upgrade option to get more space in your pockets but you have to take the time to collect more and more seeds for space that you dont need to complete the game or to have a fun time playing breath of the wild. That is just too many seeds to collect and for such little reward. it does not encourage players to find them all it is just simply something that happens throughout the game.</p><p>secondly, the game is too easy. one of the best aspects of The Legend of Zelda is the puzzles. Each game they grow more complex and is one of the reasons why it became so popular in the first place. The Zelda series started on the NES when walk thorughs did not exsist. If you got stuck on a level you had to ask your friends about it. This got people talking about it and was a fun was to connect with friends and even meet new people. In Breath of the wild it does not have temples to explore, instead it has shrines which all look the same and play the same music and all have the same rewards at the end. The shrines closest to the starting point can hardly be considered puzzels for the game clearly indicates how you should proceed. There are many hints given to you and even the slightly bigger shrines have simple puzzels. It is good for the really young Zelda fans who are just getting into the series but what about the loyal Zelda fans who have played since they were kids? The puzzles are very repetitive and loose their interest over time. Not to mention how easy the monsters are to beat once you've been to a few shrines. </p> <p> And finally, the world is just not as interesting as the past games. sure there are lots of places to go but once you've gome to the main story centered areas the rest of the world seems very baren and even lonely. The charaters that you come across repeat what they said to you the first time and even those involved with side quests don"t have much to add to the lore of the game or even the gameplay. There are a few funny charactors and memorable moments but not nearly as many as in past games. once you've met a charactor once and went throgh their story nothing gets more interesting. Some of the stories and sidequests even feel like they are left unresolved. There is not much fun in listening to charactors repeat themselves. </p><p> Also the main story is interesting but it is shown and not lived. The cutscenes you unlock are very emotional and animated very beautifully but you don't get to experience any of it fist hand. you dont get to participate in the action that is mentioned for these scenes are just memories of the past. I beleive that this was not a good choice because it feels like I missed out on a very emotional journey rather than a lonely jorney wilth bland shrines and charactors that repeat themselves. The game would've been much more enjoyable with a greater storyline that involed the player, tougher puzzels or monsters, or even side quests that actually felt like quests rather than a giant scavenger hunt that would have taken up all of your time to complete for a prize that isn't needed to play the game. Perhaps next time Nintendo should focus on creating lots of interesting content rather than how many koroks they can hide under rocks.</p>    </article>
